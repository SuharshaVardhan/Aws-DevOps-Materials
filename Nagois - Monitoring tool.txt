Nagois :

Its an open source software to monitor our application, networks an infrastructure.

It will detect network and server issues.

It has few port configurations - 5666, 5667, 5668

it helps us to find root cause of the issue. to prevent re-occurring of issues.

it will actively monitoring the entire infrastructure

it will allow you to monitor and troubleshoot server issues

automatically fix the updates

it has alert system in case any failures and it will raise alert to mail. so technical team can start server recovering process immediately

it has good log and database system.

it has attractive web interface

we can monitor entire infrastructure with single pass

we can monitor network issues like HTTP, TCP, SSH, SNMT, POP, FTP, SMTP

we install plugin to our servers to monitor issues. plugin - NRPE(Nagios remote plugin executor) agent

How we use

--> first we need to dashboard setup in one server(host)

--> for other servers monitor - we just need install NRPE plugin

command to install nrpe plugin

--> apt install nagios-plugins nagios-nrpe-server

command to check status of nagios on other servers.

--> systemctl status nagios-nrpe-server.service

In this nrpe.cfg will be there. we need to open this file. we need to provide host server ip address(public ip address/elastic ip address)

vim etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg

in server address - we need to provide host server ip address(dashboard server)

after making config file changes

we need to restart the server

systemctl restart nagios-nrpe-server.service

to check version of nagios

--> /usr/sbin/nrpe -v /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg

with this all process done in client server

In our host server we need to make few config file changes and open below file

go to host server and make changes to below config file

why means - we need to provide config details that we want to monitor

vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

we need to uncomment one directory

cfg=directory- etc/server.cfg - uncomment and copy this path and come out of file

--> cd directorypath till etc/

after gng to directory  we need to create one directory and in that one configuration file to monitor our client server

--> vim host.cfg (we need to create)

we need to provide code in json format that will get in internet

define host {
ip address client public ip address
server  Linux
max_check_attempts 5
}

we need to provide more its just a sample file 

after writing file and restart nagios

systemctl restart nagios

after restarting also it wont work because we need to provide port numbers - provide below command to allow rules

-> ufw allow 5666/tcp

after this we can track client server in nagios dashboard
