Aws CLI

Launching ec2 instance using CLP

---> Launch one instance in EC2

-> We need to launch multiple instances using CLP
-> we can use CLp means for that
-> First we have to launch one ec2 launch using keypair in aws console
-> then we can download any one terminal from internet that can be saved in locale machine like putty, mobaxterm, No machine
-> copy public ip address and open terminal we need to connect this instance to terminal
-> command - ssh ubuntu/linux@publicipaddress

-> it will ask yes/no then select yes and it will say permissiondenied

-> we need to connect using keyvalue pair(this is already created in while creating instance in ec2 this can be saved in local machine)

-> command to using keyvaule pair(it will save as .pem file) - ssh -i /users/desktop/documents/filename ubuntu@publicipadrress(mention your saved path) and then also it will say denied because its a sceret file and we need to change permissions of .pem file

-> to change the permissions of file command - chmod 600 /users/desktop/document/test.pem and it will change permissions of file then enter
-> command to connect with CLI with ec2 instance - ssh -i /users/desktop/documents/filename ubuntu@publicipadrress
