1. Diff between PSCM and webhook and build periodically

PollSCM - it will be used when dev commit the changes in specific timing(using corn syntax) only and it works only for git 

webhook - anytime when dev commit the changes in git and it will trigger build

Build periodically - it works for any tool and we can set the build time and dates by using corn syntax. according to time it will trigger the build.


2. options of parameters by using this we can automate pipeline little bit easier.

1. Boolean parameter - true or false
2. Choice parameter - Multiple options - we need to give variable at build section and mention their values/options in choice parameter section.
3. File - - this can be used when we build local file from their machine
4. STRING parameter - INPUT (in single line) - while pipeline running  if we want to pass any input we can use this in single line.
5. MULTI String parameter - MULTI-INPUT (in multi lines) - while pipeline running  if we want to pass any input we can use this in multiple lines.
