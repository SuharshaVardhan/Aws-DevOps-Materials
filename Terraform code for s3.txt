Here is an example of Terraform code to create an S3 bucket and attach a policy:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "bucket_policy" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"
    actions = [
      "s3:GetObject",
    ]
    resources = [
      aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.arn,
      "${aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.arn}/*",
    ]
    principals {
      type        = "AWS"
      identifiers = ["arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity XXXXX"]
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "bucket_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.bucket_policy.json
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

## Provider Configuration
- The `provider` block specifies the AWS region to use.

## S3 Bucket Resource
- The `aws_s3_bucket` resource creates an S3 bucket with the specified name.
- The `acl` attribute sets the access control list (ACL) of the bucket to "private".

## IAM Policy Document
- The `data` block defines an IAM policy document using the `aws_iam_policy_document` data source.
- The policy grants the `s3:GetObject` permission to the specified resources (the bucket ARN and all objects within the bucket).
- The `principals` block specifies the AWS principal (CloudFront Origin Access Identity) that is allowed to access the bucket.

## S3 Bucket Policy Resource
- The `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource attaches the IAM policy document to the S3 bucket.
- The `bucket` attribute specifies the ID of the S3 bucket to which the policy will be attached.
- The `policy` attribute sets the policy document as a JSON string.

To use this Terraform code, you need to replace `"my-unique-bucket-name"` with a unique name for your S3 bucket and provide the appropriate CloudFront Origin Access Identity ARN.

After running `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory and `terraform apply` to create the resources, the S3 bucket will be created with the specified policy attached.
